I got frustrated trying to reproduce the magic of another application relying on babel and webpack to render JSX and built this to demo the simplest way to get JSX rendered with Express.

If I expand this, it will be to add different examples of getting these servers set up. There's way too many ways to configure these transpiling middlewares and I want to identify the minimal patterns to getting an app stood up.
